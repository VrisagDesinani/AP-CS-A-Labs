Unit 10: Recursion 
**All submissions should have a Driver and Resource class
Write a class called YourNameU10E1R. The class will do the following:
 Given a class rectangle (You could use Java’s default rectangle class or create your own) with instance variables width and height, provide a recursive getArea method. Construct a rectangle whose width is 1 less than the original and call its getArea method.
Write a class called YourNameU10E2R . The class will do the following:
Given a square (You could use Java’s default rectangle class or create your own) with an instance variable width, provide a recursive getArea method. Construct a square whose width is 1 less than the original and call its getArea method.

Write a class called YourNameU10E3D. The class will do the following:                                                                                                                    
Phone numbers and pin codes can be easier to remember when you find words that spell out the number on a standard phone pad. For example, instead of remembering the combination 5282, you can just think of Java. Brady recursive method that given a number, yields all possible spellings which may or may not be real words.
Write a class called YourNameU10E4R. The class will do the following:
Write a factorial method from a number supplied by the user.
Write a class called YourNameU10E5R. The class will do the following:
Write a telephone lookup program. Read a data set of 10 names and telephone numbers from an array list or 2D array or an array or a file that contains the numbers in random order. Handle lookups by name and also reverse lookups by phone number. Use a binary search for both lookups.
