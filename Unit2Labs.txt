Unit 2: Using objects
 
Practice Exercise:
 
1.       Write a class called YourNameU2E1R. The class will do the following:
a.       Initialize two instance variables (Length, width).
Write a default constructor
b.       Write a constructor that takes one argument.
c.       Write a constructor that takes two arguments.
d.       Write a method that takes no parameters and computes the area and returns the area to the driver class.
e.       Write a method with the same name as “d” and take one argument and compute the area (yes this will be a square) and return the area to the driver..
f.        Write a method with the same name as “d” and take two arguments and compute the area and return the area to the driver.
g.       Write a class called YourNamePrint. This class will have a method called printArea, take one argument and will print the area from parts d, e, and f.
h.       Write a class called YourNameU1E1D to call the classes in parts a-f, and g.
I. call each of the constructors from the driver class. 
2.       Write a class called YourNameU2E2D. The class will do the following:
Import the Rectangle class
Using the rectangle class, declare a rectangle object with a default constructor.
Use the getWidth and getHeight methods from the rectangle class to get the width and height.
Then calculate the perimeter. 
Using the rectangle class, declare a rectangle object with a two argument constructor.
Repeat steps c and d
Using YourNamePrint from E1, make a printPerimeter method and print the perimeter of the rectangle for each of the constructors.
 
3.       Write a class called YourNameU2E3R. The class will do the following:
a.       Using Math.random, generate a nine digit number and display in the following format ###-##-####
b.       Write yourNameU2E3D to call YourNameU2E3R
 
4.       Write a class called YourNameU2E4D. The class will do the following:
a.       Download YourNameU2E4D shell code.
b.       Research the Period class
c.       Research the LocalDate class
d.       Use LocalDate to get todays date and set your
e.       Ask for the person’s birthday
f.        Use Localdate to set the persons birthday
g.       User the Period class to find the number of years, months and days from today to their birthday
h.       Use the shellcode given to enter the months
i.         Code the calculations to find the number of days, hours. Minutes, and seconds this person has been alive.
j.         Print the results to the screen.
 
5.   	Write a class called YourNameU2E5D. The class will do the following:
a.   	Writing class that reads the radius of a sphere and prints its volume and surface area.
b.   	Obtain the formulas for volume and surface area from a math book, the internet, or your memory.
c.   	Use the math class for and PI and exponents
d.   	Watch the video on printf
e.   	Use printf to format the output to 3 decimal places and use escape characters for line control
       
6.   	Write a class called YourNameU2E6R. The class will do the following:
a.   	In a resource class, enter a string of at least 20 characters and make sure you have the word “light”.
b.   	Print the string
c.   	Calculate the length in a method
d.   	Return the length to the driver class
e.   	Send the length into the print method so the print method prints the string and the length
f.        In another method, get a substring starting at the 5th character and going for 7 (inclusive)characters
g.   	Return the substring to the driver class, then send it into the print method.
h.   	In a new method, enter 2 strings and using the equals, determine if the result is true of false. Return the true or false and send it to the print method.
i.         In a new method, enter two strings and compare them. If the strings are equal return equal, if not, return string one is “larger” than string two else, return string 2 is larger than string one.  Send to the print method. Based on the output, -1, 0, 1 explain what is means.
7.       Write a class called YourNameU2E7D. The class will do the following: (Using the wrapper class)
a.       Display to the screen the minimum and maximum values of integer
b.       Make an Integer object and set it to a number;
c.       Make a double object and set it to a double.
d.       Make two different strings and put numbers in them. Make one number between 400 and 999.
e.       Change the strings to integers
f.        Add the integers and print the sum.
g.       Square the larger integer and convert it to a string using toString.
h.       Using substring, print the numbers in positions 1 and 2.
i.         Make the double into a string
j.         Print the last two digits of the double so I would make the double something like 987.124578.
