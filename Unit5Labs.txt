Unit 5: Writing classes
1.       Write a class called YourNameU5E1RBankAccount. The class will do the following:
a.       Declare an instance variable named balance
b.       code a default and one argument constructor
c.       code a method called deposit with one argument
d.       code a  method called withdraw with one argument
e.       code a method called get balance that returns the balance
f.        Write a class called YourNameU5E1DBATester Whose main method constructs a bank account, deposits $2500, withdrawals $600, withdraws another $700, then prints the remaining balance.

2.       Write a class called EmployeeYourNameU5E2R . The class will do the following:
a.       An employee has a name (a string) and a salary (a double). Provide a constructor with two arguments.
b.       Code a method called getName that returns a string
c.       Code a method called getSalary that returns a double
d.       Code a method called raiseSalary that takes in a double.
e.       The method raiseSalary should raise the employee salary by a certain percentage. Coding method that prints out the employees name, old salary, percentage increased, and new salary.
f.        Write a driver class that gets the name, current salary, percentage to raise the salary, and calls the method in part E
g.        
 
3.       Write a class called CarYourNameU5E3D. The class will do the following:
a.       Implement a class car with the following properties. A car has a certain fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon or liters per kilometer - pick one) and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank. The efficiency is specified in the constructor, and the initial fuel level is zero. Supply a method drive that simulates driving the car for a certain distance reducing the amount of gasoline in the fuel tank. Also supply method getGasInTank returning the current amount of gasoline in a car’s fuel tank after the drive and addGas to add to the fuel tank.
b.       Add an error check to make sure the miles driven is not greater than the amount of fuel. If it is, print out some funny message to the screen.
c.       Code an one argument constructor and appropriate instance variables
d.       Write a driver class that initiates a car object that supplies the miles per gallon to the one argument constructor, and calls the appropriate methods in order to test parts A&B.
e.        
4.       Write a class called YourNameU5E4R. The class will do the following:
a.       Code a default constructor that sets initial values to the instance variables you create
b.       Code a method that takes a range of numbers and sums them. 
c.       Code a method that takes a range of numbers and finds the difference of them. 
d.       Code a method that takes a range of numbers and finds the product of them. 
e.       You can use the same numbers for parts B through D or have different numbers each time, the choice is yours.
f.        Code a method that prints the results of parts B through D
g.       Write a driver class to test parts A through F.
 
5.       Write a class called YourNameU5E5R. The class will do the following:
a.       A microwave control panel has four buttons: one for increasing the time by 30 seconds, one for switching between power levels one and two, a reset button, and a start button. Implement a class that simulates the microwave with a method for each button. The method for the start button should print a message “cooking for …. Seconds at level…”
b.       Appropriate constructors should be included.
c.       Write a driver class to test part A.
 
6.       Write a class called YourNameU5E6D. The class will do the following:
a.       Implement a voting machine class that can be used for a simple election. Have methods to clear the machine state, to vote for a Democrat, to vote for a republican, and to get the tallies for both parties. End the voting with a “q”.
B. Write a driver class to run part “A”.
