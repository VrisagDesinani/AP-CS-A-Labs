/*
 Write a Class called YourNameU1E4R. This assignment will consist of converting wind speeds into different measurement units. You will continue working with methods, the Scanner class, using formulas and outputting data to the screen. You will need to research to find what 1 knot - mph ectâ€¦
Write a method that will convert wind speed from knots to:
 miles per hour. 
Kilometers per hour
Meters per second
Write a method that will convert wind speed from miles per hour to:
 Knots per hour. 
Kilometers per hour
Meters per second
Write a method that will convert wind speed from kilometers per hour to:
 Knots per hour. 
Miles per hour
Meters per second
D. Write a method that will ask the following questions:
What is the starting unit of measurement (knots, MPH, KM)
What is the current wind speed?
Then call the appropriate method. 
WE WILL WRITE THIS METHOD TOGETHER. You might have to remind me. 

E. Write a method called print and print out the wind speeds. 
 
F. Also submit your three test cases. 

G.  Write YourNameU1E4D and call the methods from YourNameU1E4R
