2.       Write a class called YourNameU8E2R . The class will do the following:
a.    
  
Then write YourNameU8E2D to test YourNameU8E2R
3.       Write a class called YourNameU8E3R. The class will do the following:
a.      
YourNameU8E3D to test YourNameU8E3R
4.       Write a class called YourNameU8E4R. The class will do the following:
a.       A supermarket wants to reward its best customer of each day, showing the customer's name on a screen in the supermarket. For that purpose, the store keeps an ArrayList<Customer>. In the store class, implement methods:
public void addSale(string customerName, double amount);
public String nameOfBestCustomer();
To record the sale and return the name of the customer with the largest sale. Write a class that prompts the cashier to enter all the prices and names, adds them to a store object, and displays the best customer's name. Use the price of 0 to terminate the loop.
b.        Then write YourNameU8E4D to test YourNameU8E4R
5.       Write a class called YourNameU8E5R. The class will do the following:
a.       Improve the class in exercise 4 so that it displays the top customers, that is, the topN customers with the largest sales, where topN is a value that the user of the program supplies. Implement a method
Public ArrayList<String> nameOfBestCustomer(int topN)
If there were fewer than topN customers, include all of them.
Then write YourNameU8E5D to test YourNameU8E5R
